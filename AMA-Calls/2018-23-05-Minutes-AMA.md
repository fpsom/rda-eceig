## Q&A

### RDA Related

- [List of RDA Members](https://www.rd-alliance.org/members)

*Q1: What would be the sources of funding to establish this network?

Lynn: look for existing partners; staring from repository perspective work with someone who has already infrastructure and can support this- eg re3data
recommendation: partner strategically

Sarah: there are many repositories - there are some funders supporting such development; Consortia such as the RDAEurope helping with improvement 

Pete: FAIRSharing - look there to see what’s there for life and natural sciences - could reach out to them and see how collaborations could be achieved; also other projects providing funding opportunities, eg EOSCpilot


*Q2: RDA involvement - how to interact and participate fully with RDA?
How to make people understand about RDA?

- everyone can join as member, no limit to senior or early careers - WGs, IGs around many activities
- next Plenary in Gaborone - good for networking
- look at the outputs from different groups and see if they can be adopted


### Professional Development



### Networking Capacity
 *Q1: Networking? How to achieve that in different domains?

Raman: RDA can help because you have the opportunity to see people working in same things with different backgrounds etc

Sarah and Lynn: Maybe worth looking at Data groups for reproducibility , blockchain + Agriculture groups; RDAgroups.org for contact, enquiries -> you can start your own group as well, maybe as a BoF or TF? + attend meetings

### Other
 *Q1: What are the plans for Botswana? 
 
Devan: submit and run a session explaining the Mentoring Programme, getting to know each other and introduce mentors to mentees, have discussions for research interests; provide support in any way possible
