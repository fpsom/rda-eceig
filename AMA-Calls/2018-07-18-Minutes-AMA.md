### Code of Conduct

[RDA Code of Coduct](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/rda-council-private/outcomes/draft-comment-rda-code-conduct)
- Respect others and their contributions
- Don’t make people feel uncomfortable
- No means no

### Structure of the call

1. **Welcome**
Fotis welcomed everyone and run through the agenda and the topics to be discussed. 
Reminded that the AMA calls are monthly, on the third Wednesday of each month. However, due to the Summer holidays, the August one (i.e. August 15th) will **not** take place.

2. **Round of introductions**
    
    _ _(a) Who am I, (b) Where am I, (c) What is my specialization / What am I looking for here_

    * **Mentors**
    
        _Peter McQuilton_:
        Works at Oxford e-Research Centre. Coordinator of the FAIRSharing project, which maps the landscape of databases, standards and data policies in the life scieneces and beyond! They also address FAIR aspects of data in several disciplines (including the Natural Sciences). RDA connection to the BioSharing WG and ELIXIR IG. Background in Biology, but now more about data sharing, standards and FAIR data.
        
        _Lynn Yarmey_:
        Background in Data Management. RDA/US Community Development Director. Bachelors is in geophysics

        _Raman Ganguly_:
        University of Vienna; Technical side - infrastruture for data management
        
        _Jörg Geiger_:
        University of Wuerzburg. Handling the fluids biobank. Interdisciplinary. Background in physical chemistry. In RDA, mostly  involvend in persistent identifier - big problem in biobanks as there is no consistent attribution/annotation.

    * **Mentees**
         
         _Joao Miranda_:
         From ESTG/IPP; CERENA/IST. Data Science related with Biophysics. Petrochemical and pharmaceutical. Involved in a COST action that may be relevant to the members of RDA.
     
         _Sarah Ramdeen_:
         From UAH ESSC.
         
         _Carole Urlings_:
          I recently joined the university of Brussels at the Research information and data management department as a research data manager in the R&D team who introduced me to RDA, so I'm very new here! I'm mostly working on how to bring good RD practices to all the researchers at this university. My background is in psychology and digital humanities.
          
         _Ana Slavec_:
         from Slovenia consulting statistician

3. **Three (plus one) Sections of Q&A**
    - RDA-related
    - Professional Development
    - Networking Capacity
    - Other

4. **Closing, plan for next AMA**
    - Every third Wednesday of the month (_**not** in August 2018_)
    - **[Next one (4th AMA) Wednesday, September 19th](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=RDA+ECEIG+3rd+AMA&iso=20180919T10&p1=3723&ah=1)**


## Q&A


### RDA Related

 - [List of RDA Members](https://www.rd-alliance.org/members)
 - In order to keep connected to the audience, Peter uses the RDA mailing list and social media. Sentiment also echoed by the other mentors on call.

- (_@Lynn_): There are a ton of education activities going on right now across RDA (much less beyond), maybe we can do a quick summary of some of the programs/groups/efforts and offer advice on where to start?
    - (_@Fotis_) This is an excellent idea! There is at least one (that I know of) RDA group that is involved with education and training.
        - [Education and Training on handling of research data IG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/education-and-training-handling-research-data.html)
    - Also two "historical/closed" groups
        - [Teaching TDM on Education and Skill Development WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/teaching-tdm-education-and-skill-development-wg)
        - [Certification and Accreditation for Data Science Training and Education WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/certification-and-accreditation-data-science-training-and-education-wg)
    - (_@Raman_) We are also working on a trining material. This will be in  German on the first hand but we will translate it. I am happy to share the English version with the group. We started with the infrastructure and struggle a lot with policies an organization issues


### Professional Development
 - How can people be involved / help out in the [COST Action "Medicines Shortages" (CA15105)](http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/ca/CA15105) that Joao mentioned?
     - There is a [survey released by the EU](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/PatientsPerspectivesOnMedicinesShortagesV2).
     - Need to deal with Data Management, Intellectual Property
     - Integral part of the COST action is to deploy Data Science tools by simultaneously addressing "the patients' perspective on drugs shortages" AND "the public reports from national authorities".
     - (_@Lynn_) the Health Data IG may be another place to advertise


- Data Management Plan in other disciplines:
    - (@_Carole_): This the [site in Dutch](http://www.vub.ac.be/onderzoek/beleid/information-datamanagement), but we're working on completely renewing it at the moment
    - (_@Lynn_): I just went to my second biomedical data/knowledge meeting last week - there are such huge differences between the biomed community and others I’ve connected with.  I thought I had seen most types of data communities…not so much :)  Learn something new every day!


- (_@Carole_) So mostly we're working on making a real tangible research data management policy for the university as well as making trainings/workshops for the researchers it's not been really obvious, because it's a pretty new field it's hard to find any standardized information
    - (_@Pete_)Thanks really interesting Carole and something we in FAIRsharing would *definitely* be interested in helping you with
    - there's a lot of infortmation all over the place, but the hard part lies in making it centralized and clear for people who are completely now to this
    - (_@Lynn_) university policies and training are terribly difficult to do well
    - (_@Pete_) Yes, education and communication is key
    - (_@Elli_) OpenAIRE is also working on OS policies. Perhaps worth connecting to your [National Open Access Desk (NOAD)](https://www.openaire.eu/contact-noads)
    - (_@Raman_) At the University of Vienna we don’t have a department for data management - we have on the library and on the computer center a group how is doing this together. Over the years we developed a workflow model for communication to the people who is responsible for what in data management
    - (_@Carole_) We are struggling a bit with what we want to implement versus the budget that's available to us, so another challenge is just to spread awareness about rdm before we can even get the necessary infrastructre/people

- (_@Devan_) Project on DMPs and cyberinfrastructure; study how researchers are managing their data and how realistic their practices are - this will help to have a better idea and how to proceed with and frame the infrastucture -> Worldwide 
    - (_@Pete_) ELIXIR is already working on something similar, so I can definitely put you in contact.
    - (@Lynn_) There are several compenents to keep track of. This is a necessary aspect (as a horizontal / landscape perspective of the situation). RDA groups that may be of interest
        - FAIRsharing/BioSharing IG (Pete is a co-chair)
        - Active DMPs IG
        - Open Questionnaire IG
        - Chemistry IG
        - Earth Science IG


### Networking Capacity


### Other


### I can offer... / I need help in...
- **Pete**: I can offer advice in data sharing, data management, metadata schema, the use of standards and repositories etc. Happy to help where I can and happy to learn about different disciplines.
