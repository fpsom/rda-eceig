3. **Topic of the month**: "_How to get cited more_" (by Devan Ray Donaldson)

How to write/structure CV and use complementary tools for raising awareness about your research and about you as a researcher.
- CV: what to include; keep it current
- Personal Website: informative and up to date; info about publications, bio and link to CV; some universities provide such space eg wordpress; link personal to organisational website
- create account in Google Scholar
- create an ORCID to distinguish yourself from others and have a collection of your papers; include ORCID to your CV
- ResearchGate for research dissemination: you can follow others, you can ask questions and have controk on who accesses your reseacrh
- LinkedIn: info like in the CV but with more capabilities; employers have a look there which creates job opportunities 
- Institutional Repository (IR): add it in your IR for long term access, also for pre-prints eg for Indiana University is te IUScholar Works 

Additional work? Shouldn't be a burden because research communication is equally valuable

**Mark**: Do you think you can promote yourself too much?
**Devan**: Probably not. So many people out there that you might try to connect with. Even if you do everything, you might not connect with people you'd like.
**Mark**: It may go too far. Every discipline has its own decorum, so you might need to "constraint" yourself so as not to seem too "desperate". Another point, in order to increase visibility, taking leadership roles its very important. Finally, in addition to keeping a short CV, you might also think of consolidating your presence: not only publications, but also posters, code, RDA outputs, anything that reflects your work.
**Elli**: Some of the services you shown are actually commercial services. You, as a user, know what data is there but you don't know how it's being ultimately used. With GDPR in EU, it makes a lot of sense to maintain / monitor your data. What are your thoughts?
**Devan**: Understanding the service documentation so that you have a better handle.


4. **Three (plus one) Sections of Q&A**
    - RDA-related
    - Professional Development
    - Networking Capacity
    - Other

5. **Closing, plan for next AMA**
    - Every third Wednesday of the month 
        - Next one is [**Wednesday, November 21st**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=RDA+ECEIG+5th+AMA&iso=20181121T10&p1=3723&ah=1)


## Q&A

- Does "over-toot" exist? 
-- Not sure. Some think that this can be done. It's important to make yourself visible but be mindful of how you do it. Academic disciplines have their rules and in some cases tooting is appropriate but in others not. Hardest is community engagement.
In terms of CVs it's important that you have a short bio.
Include all research outputs in the repository. 

For Linkedin eg notthe full-text
If you have the right to pre-print you put it where you want. Otherwise, for eg in the bio, write and contextualise the significance of an award received for example. Come down to what info you share; do you have rights to or not; do you care about how it's presented?

Fotis agrees with Elli. Thinks it's too much to try and have all those accounts.

Not sure Lynn agrees especially from a gender perspective and from the early career perspective

It’s important to appear confident but not arrogant. A fine line.

### RDA Related

- Small discussion about Botswana, logistics and the session about newcomers and connecting them with early careers

### Professional Development

- Information presented is part of professional development. Focusses more on how this is communicated with others.
