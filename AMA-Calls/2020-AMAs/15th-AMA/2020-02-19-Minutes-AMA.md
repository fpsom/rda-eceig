3. **Topic of the month**: ["Archiving and referencing all software source code using Software Heritage "](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/early-career-and-engagement-ig/event/ask-me-anything-call-archiving-and-referencing-all)

**Short bio**

An alumnus of the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, with a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Pisa, Roberto Di Cosmo was associate professor for almost a decade at Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris. In 1999, he became a Computer Science full professor at University Paris Diderot, where he was head of doctoral studies for Computer Science from 2004 to 2009. A trustee of the IMDEA Software institute, and member of the national committee for Open Science in France, he is currently on leave at Inria.

introduction and background from Prof di Cosmo
started Software Heritage 5 years ago
software everywhere - software contains precious knowledge about how software works, i.e. source code
source code is the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it
much better to look at the programe source code rather than hack binary code
comments are messages from one developer to another
the knowledge in the source code is lost in the binary form
programs should be written for humans to read mainly and incidentally for the computer to interpret

important to understand the history of software development
software doesn't live in isolation 
most of software today builds on existing libraries and components
need software to read and interpret data
software is a pillar in science because it is used everywhere- but it is a forgotten pillar, e.g. EOSC plan the word software appears only once 
lack of consensus on archiving software, licensing, 

interest in software code in increasing, especially with regards to reproducing and verifying results of an experiment, also for modifying and evolving experiments - need access to source code

software should be archived and versioned so it can be discoverable and retrieved

citation is a very precise science of giving credit to the authors

archival, identification, metadata and citation

need to collect, preserve and share software code

reference catalogues, e.g. source forage, github, gitlab, etc. are numerous but no universal one exists

it is important to have a universal archive to preserve source code

software heritage archives all software source code

Software Heritage has been adopted by French Open Science
 Version Control preservesa record of the software before and after changes to it

["Software Heritage: Why and How to Preserve Software Source Code"](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01590958)


version contron has evolved over the years, from local vcs in the 1980s to 
distributed vcs (e.g. git)  today, 90 million repositories archived in 2019

each piece of software should have an intrinsic identifier - the software itself defines the unique identifier

the unique identifier includes an object identifier


example of source code link online that no longer works vs what's possible now where the source code link is preserved

what does intrinsically identified mean ?
identifer includes origin of code
file can be downloaded from the identifier link
can compute the hash of the downloaded file locally on machine
these identifers do not need a central repository to be meaningful - so they are preservable

a doi requires trust in the tools that maintain that doi, e.g. doi resolver, url, integrity verifier, - see page 16 of slides

a trust model only requires that you trust the hashing algorithm


good practice to prepare a readme 

software heritage can prepare an intrinsic identifer in a matter of hours

the origin link is important to show where the code originated

should ackowledge everyone who has an input into the development of the software code

important to reference exact source code for reproducibility 

conclusion

research software is a pillar of open science, finally it is being recognised

software code is not just data






4. **Q&A**

    - Professional Development
    - Networking Capacity
    - Other





5. **Closing, plan for next AMA**
    - Every third Wednesday of the month. We'll be skipping the AMA for March, as it coincides with the 15th RDA Plenary in Melbourne, Australia.  
        - Next one is [**Wednesday, April 15th**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=RDA+ECEIG+January+AMA&iso=20200415T10&p1=3723&ah=1)



## Q&A

how to credit those who contribute in any way to the development of the code ?

you need to have some curator or moderator
some tools produce automatically for software by extracting handles from github, but this can get quite lengthy 

no simple solution- for acknowledge complexity of contribution and try to see what the contribution has been 

not resolved as of yet

reminder to people to attend the Source Code Interest Group in Melbourne
