3. **Topic of the month**: ["dkNET"](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/early-career-and-engagement-ig/event/ask-me-anything-call-what-do-you-really-know-about)


This AMA will present the dkNET platform developed to help US researchers to comply with NIH mandates and policies.

Participants will have the opportunity to learn about services and tools provided through dkNET and become familiar with both concepts of creating detailed research resource reports and producing authentication reports for NIH.

Invited speaker: Dr Maryann Martone, FAIR Data Informatics Lab (FDI Lab), University of California, San Diego

**Short bio**
Maryann Martone received her BA from Wellesley College in Biological Psychology and Ancient Greek and her Ph. D. in Neuroscience from the University of California, San Diego. She is a professor Emerita at UCSD, but still maintains an active laboratory, the FAIR Data Informatics Lab.   She started her career as a neuroanatomist, specializing in light and electron microscopy, but her main research for the past 15 years focused on informatics for neuroscience, i.e., neuroinformatics.  She led the Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF), a national project to establish a uniform resource description framework for neuroscience, and the NIDDK Information Network (dknet), a portal for connecting researchers in digestive, kidney and metabolic disease to data, tools, and materials.  She just completed 5 years as Editor-in-Chief of Brain and Behavior, an open access journal, and has just launched a new journal as Editor in Chief, NeuroCommons, with BMC.  Dr. Martone is past President of FORCE11, an organization dedicated to advancing scholarly communication and e-scholarship.  She completed two years as the chair of the Council on Training, Science and Infrastructure for the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility and is now the chair of the Governing Board.  Since retiring, she served as the Director of Biological Sciences for Hypothesis, a technology non-profit developing an open annotation layer for the web (2015-2018) and founded SciCrunch, a technology start up based on technologies developed by NIF and dkNET.  She currently serves as Chief Scientific Officer of SciCrunch.  https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8406-3871

**Minutes:** 

Key Services of dkNET (they are an aggregator site): 
a. Discovery Portal
b. Hypothesis tools
c. Resource Reports
d. Authentication Reports
e. FAIR Data Resources


What a resource report includes
- key metadata, citations, who uses it etc

dkNET aggregates alert info from many sources; concerns -> problematic alerts are highlighted and you have to be careful on how to use it

Resource Information Network
Research Resource Identifier (RRI) is a PID for resources that helps with identifying resources - what resources have been used and who else has used it ; in the past it was difficult to have this information

Important that RRIDs are integrated into the publication pipelines

How to search for antibody:
table View slide

Resource Watch - currently in development;
about text mining; to be released during the next months

Find mentions based on location (in beta) - papers of people in the area

Authentication Reports - follow NIH Guidelines;
they are sent before the application and provide results based on a checklist   



4. **Q&A**
    - RDA-related
    - Professional Development
    - Networking Capacity
    - Other

1. Do you have any way to collate info when companies sell the same antibody clone under different names?
They are trying - this is considered trade secret; when they get the information they map to RRID; it is a major issue but they are trying to resolve it

2. Tell me how you pull in the validation information? Is it all from literature, or do you take anything that the companies provide?
Not in the validation report, but validation info coming from big centers that do validation, other services, etc. For literature it's coming.

3. Can your results show up in Google search or other web-based searches?  I understand that lots of researchers go to Google for antibodies instead of specialized searches?
Not the antibody one, but the other services are. They are hoping to have it as info box in Google, that's the ultimate goal. RRID are in general designed search friendly and do not require the use of other tools to resolve them.


5. **Closing, plan for next AMA**
    - Every third Wednesday of the month.   
        - Next one is [**Wednesday, September 16th**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=RDA+ECEIG+September+AMA&iso=20200916T10&p1=3723&ah=1)
