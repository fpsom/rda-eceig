### Code of Conduct

[RDA Code of Coduct](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/rda-council-private/outcomes/draft-comment-rda-code-conduct)
- Respect others and their contributions
- Don’t make people feel uncomfortable
- No means no

### Structure of the call

1. **Welcome**
    - Fotis welcomed everyone and run through the agenda and the topics to be discussed.
    - Reminded that the AMA calls are monthly, on the third Wednesday of each month. This means that our next AMA call will be [**Wednesday, January 16th**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=RDA+ECEIG+5th+AMA&iso=20190110T10&p1=3723&ah=1) - -however, given its proximity to the holiday period, we will be confirming this in the beginning of the new year.
    - At the end of the document, we have an _"I can offer... / I need help in..."_ Section. Feel free to add anything there.
    - We will be thanking all of you in an ECEIG tweet after this call. So if you are interested, please add your twitter handles.

 
2. **Round of introductions**
    
    _( a ) Who am I, ( b ) Where am I, ( c ) What is my specialization / What am I looking for here_


    * **Mentors**
- Fiona Murphy - interested to join as a mentor to this group. Also leading a project that could be of relevance to this group.
- Marta Teperek - data stewardship coordinator at TU Delft. Support early career researchers with their research 
- Raman Ganguly, from the perspective of infrastructure it's always useful to see the user point of view.

    * **Mentees**
- Deborah Agarwood is at Drexel in Pennsylvania, US. My research interests are digital curation, archives, research data management. I joined this group to learn more about data.



3. **Three (plus one) Sections of Q&A**
    - RDA-related
    - Professional Development
    - Networking Capacity
    - Other

4. **Closing, plan for next AMA**
    - Every third Wednesday of the month 
        - Next one is [**Wednesday, January 16th**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=RDA+ECEIG+5th+AMA&iso=20190110T10&p1=3723&ah=1)



## Q&A
- Raman sees a DMP similar to a project management plan- you have to adapt as the project goes and add metadata , update when needed
- Marta: researchers should see the value behind the DMP; funders as well - not to be perceived as a burden - at TU Deft they have a team of experts (lawyers, ethics experts, etc) and are intending to created a minimum required questions agreed by the University to be answered by researchers
- Devan: working in a lab of 5 disciplines to understand what the data are and how are data managed in the context of the project and how to utilise library resources in this activity.
    - Deborah: Five is a lot! We found that researchers would benefit from that support but don’t always realize they can get it.
- [2015 survey for all Austrian Universities about RDM](https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/view/o:409318) - could be useful for other countries and regions 

- Funders request or require you to submit a DMP; top-down approach; more funders are realsing the bebefits and libraries are moving towards establishmnet of repository and consultative services
    - In DID, which was international, DMP and PM were both mandated. They all submitted plans and dealt with PM in different ways. But there’re no enforcement, and the researchers’ outcomes were quite various. White papers and websites were mandated, as was sustainability. Few websites were live two years after the grant ended, as far as we could find.

- RDA Groups active in Data Management Plans
    - [Active Data Management Plans IG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/active-data-management-plans.html)
    - [Research Data Management in Engineering](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/research-data-management-engineering)

- Actionable DMP is new, I think, and makes sense. I think LIS-IS professionals have a role in actionable DMPs. Raman, DID is primarily digital humanities.

- There are a lot of activities right now in DMP (DMP-Tool, [Data Stewardship Wizard](https://dsw.fairdata.solutions/), etc). So it may increase the confusion of the end users.



### RDA Related



### Professional Development

- Deborah Agarwood - My advisor and I wrote some papers about the Digging into Data Challenge. My main interest following that research is data management plans for publicly-funded projects. DMP Tool, for example, is out there but few researchers seem to use it. Whole Tale seems like a DMP in mid-stream, post-project and pre-repository. So it’s different from the DMP Tool model. That is, no researchers in our study used DMP tool. We had a range from people who didn’t know what a DMP was all the way to people who said it was essential. The problem seems to be that the DMP isn’t perceived as flexible. It changes during the project. We found that to be true; project management and data management go together.
