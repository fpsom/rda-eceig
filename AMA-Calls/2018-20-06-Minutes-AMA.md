### Structure of the call

0. Welcome
Fotis welcomed everyone and run through the agenda and the topics to be discussed. He then presented a possible approach of the date/time AMAs are going to be taking place in the established set of AMA series, based on:
    - [Discuss time zones](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?day=21&month=6&year=2018&p1=224&p2=179&p3=136&p4=26&p5=176&p6=152&iv=0)
 
2. Round of introductions:
    - Who am I
    - Where am I
    - What is my specialization / What am I looking for here



* **Mentors**

_Marta Teperek, TU Delft, Data Stewardship Coordinator_
Happy to help and learn from others how researchers, either in their early career or in more advanced/senior stages of their career, engage in RDM activities
Areas of interest and knowledge in: data stewardship, open science, data management, data sharing, open data, data privacy, repositories, FAIR Data

_Sarah Ramdeen, University of Alabama and RDA_
recent PhD in Information and Library Science; working at the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. 
"I work with Earth Science data, and I am particuarly interested in how people find and access data as a secondary user (which involves archival and stewardship concepts as well as community building).  I am excited to be part of this community of early career folks as we figure out how to navigate our changing landscape.""


* **Mentees**

_Ricarda Braukmann, DANS_
background in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH); performing an assessment of the RDA groups related to SSH
interested in: FAIR data,policy, data management, communication 

_Kyle Van Gaeveren, Vrije Universiteit Brussel_
working at the research coordination office at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel 
"I'm tasked with getting our university's RDM policy and support up and running. But, currently, we're focussing on getting a group of interested parties/researchers involved and organizing workshops and gathering requirements for institutional services.
I attended my first RDA meeting last time in Berlin, so I'm looking forward to getting more up to speed with the different groups and how we can participate and perhaps get some insights on how to better organise the institutional support.""

_Joao Miranda, ESTG/IPP; CERENA/IST_
In Portugal, professor of mathematics and analysis
Interested in learning more about: data management, privacy and IPR. Also about programmes for mentoring and early careers


3. Three (plus one) Sections of Q&A
    - RDA-related
    - Professional Development
    - Networking Capacity
    - Other
4. Closing, plan for next AMA
    - Every third Wednesday of the month
    - **Next one (3rd AMA) Wednesday, July 18th**[](https://)
    - Putting together a short write-up on the ECEIG AMA meetings. **Quotes are very welcome!**


## Q&A


### RDA Related

 - [List of RDA Members](https://www.rd-alliance.org/members)

- Anyone joining P12?
    - If there is funding
        - Apply for an early career travel fund - eligible to do so only once
        - Plenaries also tend to announce travel funding (if any)


- Are any of you submitting sessions to scidatacon?(_do you know what it is?_)
    - Marta has submitted a [session](https://www.scidatacon.org/IDW2018/sessions/181/), so feel free to submit

- Mapping of topics for RDA Groups / activities
    - There is going to be an update at the TAB meeting tomorrow on what was presented at the chairs meeting on this topic.  I can reply back on slack afterwards.
    - I think they are developing a classification now but nothing exists.  So if you make anything, they may be interested in posting/sharing it as a blog etc. And it is good to hear that this is a real concern, the people working on this will be glad to hear.
    - That sounds great. Im happy to share it and I will be writing a short report on the outcomes for RDAEurope 4.0




### Professional Development

 - (_Ricarda_) How DMPs are created and then used, across different disciplines? How do you use the execution of DMPs in different disciplines to provide a tool defining the respective cyber infrastructure?
    - It's interesting to see how you can connect the local groups to the more global perspective you are describing.
    - Well part of that is training the reviewers to ensure the plans are possible/complete (sorry if that has been addressed)

- (_Devan_) 
- How to link scientists to specific domain repositories regarding the implemenation of DMPs; how DMPs are created and executed is useful information for managers and domain repository managers to better provide researchers with data and better deposit and  utilise this data etc
Think DMP as artifact -> how do you actually execute (study creation and execution of DMPs)

    - Science Europe are creating Domain protocols for RDM - this is top down though
    - machine readable DMPs could provide answers to some of the above


- Pairing information and library science students with data science students (team up in 6 domains); How do you study the culture of science -> how do you know that this is successful?; how can you measure the impact of this interaction in the quality of work/data sharing in a given lab/group?
    - If you want to measure it, making sure that there is an understanding of why data sharing is meaningful.
    - There is a correlation between understanding of FAIR principles and the data sharing culture. Not a clear correlation between the existence of a DMP and data sharing.
    - [Survey on Data visualisation](https://openworking.wordpress.com/2018/02/07/do-as-you-preach-results-of-2017-data-management-survey-now-published/) - the actual data available [here](https://zenodo.org/record/1164398). Marta is more than happy to collaborate if anyone is interested!





### Networking Capacity



### Other

- (_Kyle_) One thing I'm struggling with is how to organise the workshop/requirements gathering for these institutional services. So I'm really still looking for any framework that can help with that, i.e. getting their practices and needs on RDM.
    - There is a training and education IG at RDA, which is helping to connect to educational materials on these types of topics.  So they may be able to point you to resources.
    - [Education and Training IG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/education-and-training-handling-research-data.html)
    - Also ESIP has a data management portal with training materials....
    - [The DMT Clearinghouse](http://dmtclearinghouse.esipfed.org/)
    - [FOSTER Open Science](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/taxonomy/term/7)
    - [Collaborative Approaches to Building an Engaged RDM Community](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/28/103895)
    - [Zenodo repository on RDM training materials](https://zenodo.org/communities/dcc-rdm-training-materials/?page=1&size=20)
    - And a [blog post from Cambridge on understanding the needs of the users](https://unlockingresearch-blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=221)

 - (_Joao_) Identifying eusurvey patients' perspectives on medicines shortages. In addition to the DMP we need to also address data privacy
     - [Health Data](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/health-data.html)
     - [Privacy implications](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rdaniso-privacy-implications-research-data-sets-wg.html)



### I can offer... / I need help in...

Feel free to add anything that you can offer (as help/collaboration), or anything you need to help in.


### Quotes
_Ricarda_: The call was very useful for me, it brought me in contact with the right people and helped me to find the information I needed for my project on assessing RDA groups and outputs relevant for social sciences researchers.
