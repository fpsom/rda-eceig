3. **Topic of the month**: ["FSCI: Reproducibility theory and practice. "](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/early-career-and-engagement-ig/event/ask-me-anything-call-fsci-reproducibility-theory-and)

**Short bio**

Dr. Anita Bandrowski trained as a neurophysiologist at UCR and Stanford, however moved to bioinformatics with the human genome project at Celera Inc., seeing that high throughput science has much to teach biologists. Dr. Bandrowski works at the FAIR Data Informatics Lab at UCSD and is also an instructor for the FSCI summer institute, teaching the Research Reproducibility in Theory and Practice course https://www.force11.org/fsci/2019/course-abstracts#AM3.  This course focuses on issues of reproducibility in research from a broad perspective. Dr. Bandrowski is also one of the founders of and oversees the Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) project  https://scicrunch.org/resources – which provides a Resource Identification Portal supporting new guidelines for Rigor and Transparency in biomedical publications.

What the Summer School is about - students stay in the dorms
addition of data visualisation - lots of hands on activities eg for the tools
thee is reproducility but focus is the biological studies
instructors are ...
Why reproducibility in Biological science?
interventions that were not effective in clinical trials - Fair early Fail often?
clinical trials should not be taken for granted - expensive + ethical (peoples lives)
FAIR for machines -> ELIXIR etc in Europe are working on that in the area of Life Sciences
long tail of science ->also unpublished and 'dark' data 
data + analysis = result
have to talk the same language - same understanding of what it is
differenec between meta-analysis and mega-analysis -> meta-analysis in archives not only looking at statistics reported in a paper
How do you put everything together? images, stats, etc
Syndromic space -> 
FAIR Partnership -> every lab should not be responsible for all FAIR -> many actors involved who have to do their part -> researchers + repositories + indexed aggregators
insufficient reporting of methodological approaches -> decrease our bias by following a blinded assessment
protocols.io 
similar to recipies - step 1: materials step 2:methods
not enough information = not sufficient
NIH new grant review crteria - transparency is crucial
do we publish contaminated cell lines? - how to authenticate a cell line? ICLAC https://iclac.org/
do we authenticate antibodies? - can be done from RRID https://scicrunch.org/resources
Anatomy of RRID; eLIFE has RRIDs
*code and data with publications

slide with reproducible tools + people to help

Things to try: Docker, RRID, Zenodo, protocols.io



4. **Q&A**
    - RDA-related
    - Professional Development
    - Networking Capacity
    - Other

Q: So, what are the responsibilities of editors and peer reviewers in enforcing standards?  Also what responsibility do the publishers bear?
A: There are responsibilities and journals that have taken this forward. They have a part to play; e.g. adding a PID. If the journals don't ask tehm to do certain things then researchers go on without practicing what is perceived as a "good practice". It is all about the FAIR Partnership. The journal can not eveything by themselves 

Q: I also wanted to ask about the responsibility of reviewers - reproducing a paper is a very time consuming task. I have been involved in running the first Reproducibility Initiative in the International Semantic Web Conference and we had a Programme Committee of reproducers.Reviewers already provide their time for free, and asking them to reproduce is a very high commitment to ask

A: It's a huge committment. Unless there is a specific fund to do this, it is not common that they reprocuce studies. There should be homage to reproducibility: eg catalogue, versioning, find all animals, find code and data. There are steps that everyone should and can take
Put PIDs in the paper
Theer are concrete and straight-forward steps that could help

Q: Question about FAIR. How does it relate to FAIR data?
A: FAIR data is required for reproducibility of analysis especially. Structure data for a community repository; data type metadata is easier to facilitatte a meta-analysis. Replicate and test hypotheses.

Q: Data formats. What is the best format to represent them? eg RDF?
A: Life Scientists don't understand RDF but tabular data! spreadsheets
RDF is a great format but for numerical data you need something taht is more open and standard that is used din the field. No perfect solution. In general: more open solutions

Q: Did you find anything useful in ontologies? They are helpful in getting more info. Did you have any use of that?
A: It is useful. Unfortunately, what comes out from the studies is complicated. Something that will happen clearer in the future.




5. **Closing, plan for next AMA**
