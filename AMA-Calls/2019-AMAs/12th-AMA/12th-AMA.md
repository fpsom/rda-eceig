### Code of Conduct

[RDA Code of Coduct](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/rda-council-private/outcomes/draft-comment-rda-code-conduct)
- Respect others and their contributions
- Don’t make people feel uncomfortable
- No means no

### Structure of the call

1. **Welcome**

Elli welcomed everyone at the September AMA call which focused on Data Management and Data Planning. She then introduced the guest speakers: Karsten Kryger Hansen, research data management coordinator at the Aalborg University, DK and Christine Staiger, data stewardshp coordinator at the Dutch Techcentre for lifesciences, NL.

The presentations started with Karsten introducing the basics of Research Data Management and posing interesting questions regarding data lifecycles vs data flows, reproducibility and security of data.

Following, Christine's talk explained the role of data stewards as resulted by a Dutch research (data stewardship framework). Christine highlighted the importance of infrastructure to data handling and storage, and incorporated few basic examples of life sciences data management.


 
2. **Round of introductions**
    
    _( a ) Who am I, ( b ) Where am I, ( c ) What is my specialization / What am I looking for here_

- Nicolas here. Data steward at TU Delft
- Yan Wang, also data stewards at TU Delft 
- Enrico Mercado, RDM Specialist at IRRI, Philippines
- Hi, I'm Kathryn! I am a data analyst at the Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International (CABI), based in the UK. I am an analyst increasingly engaged with stewardshipship in my role :) nice to meet you all!
- Marta: I’m freshly minted librarian with strong interest in data librarianship and RDM

3. **Topic of the month**: ["Data Management and Data Planning"](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/early-career-and-engagement-ig/event/ask-me-anything-call-data-management-and-data-planning)

[Karsten's presentation](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3445220)

"I don't believe in lifecycles. I believe in (data) flows
- Reproducibility;
- It's the planning process, not the plan as a file
- Link to the flow that they have developed?
- Security when sharing data on your email
- What happens when you leave your institution but you have been using that email account to upload data in Zenodo?



Christine Staiger's presentation (in the ECEIG GitHub repo)

- talk about defining problems associated with data management - seeing where they are and how we can solve them
- it's more complicated when you are asked to share data - it was easier when you were the sole data manager
- what if your colleague(s) change the data ?
- changes in data affect reproducibility
-  conclusions: document code + cultural shift beyond dealing with data to dealing with mistakes
- consider data management from a selfish persective - how much it cost me, how long did take me, how much time does it cost for me to explain to someone else, etc. 
- FAIR data stewardship - could that be the answer ?
- the data life cycle describes the research phase - an institute develops it own (including institution-relevant descriptions)
- inventories data services for handling data according to data life cycle
- FAIR principles should also take into account legal requirements (are you allowed to combine different particular data sources ?)
- think about for whom the Data needs to be FAIR
- persistent identifiers are an important component of FAIR data
- Data Stewardship: usability, resuability and reproducibilit of data
- we need Data Stewards to act as the glue between the three major stake holders






4. **Q&A**
    - RDA-related
    - Professional Development
    - Networking Capacity
    - Other

5. **Closing, plan for next AMA**
    - Every third Wednesday of the month 
        - Next one is [**Wednesday, October 16th**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=RDA+ECEIG+October+AMA&iso=20191016T10&p1=3723&ah=1)



## Q&A


* Q by Mohammad: _How about using proprietary formats_
    Jupyter notebook instead of excel

* Q by Mervyn: _Is there any scope for quality checking in the data plan?_
Christine:
data management plans usually don't check for quality
repositories check quality of data 
Karsten:
depends on template of DMP - however most often it is left with the researchers other documentation, such as methods description. Use of services like protocols.io can also be an option, making your method description citable as well.
important to mention versioning with data, at least this helps maintain data quality assurance

* Q by Nicolas Dintzner: _In your institution, how to answer to the question:"who controls/evaluate the DMP ?"... Do you put that as the work of the data steward ?_

Christine:
In Netherlands if you apply for research grant you are asked for DMP, feedback will be given on DMP
institutions see themselves as advisors rather than being presctiptive with feedback

Karsten:
Introduce this to PhD students who have contact with supervisor, supervisors pay attention to DMPs submitted by students
multiple institutions request DMPs which are reviewed, however they are not a contract, so the are not reviewed with a high degree of focus on being in  control

Q by Yan: Agree that data life cycle is a good tool to introduce RDM practices, esp, to junior researchers who still need to learn how to do research and how to manage the data. when they're experienced in research, they'd naturally focus on data flows. 

- make your own version of data life cycle 

*Q: _From MOGOTLHW: I appreciate role of data stewardship among the 3 stakeholderes. What happens when data stewardship leaves the organisation?_

Christine:
build up network of data stewards

- Any resources for FAIR?
https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618
This is the link to the original publication on FAIR

A FAIRy tale; http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2248200 
The Go-FAIR website is a good source

Q from Martie van Deventer: _I see much emphsis on planning data management. Are you aware of projects that rather focus on reuse / dissemination of well-managed data?_

A: A lot of academic communities have great data portals. An example is https://www.wormbase.org that provides data related to the specific usage of some worm species in biology. Maybe not a FAIR ressource as such, but a strict use of ontologies etc. maintained and updated by the community.
