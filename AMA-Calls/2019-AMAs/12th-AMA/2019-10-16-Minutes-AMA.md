3. **Topic of the month**: ["CODATA: The Committee on Data of the International Science Council"](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/early-career-and-engagement-ig/event/ask-me-anything-call-codata-16th-october-2019-1500-1600)

**Slides** of the talk are available [**here**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2zhprp1zpztljhv/19-10-16-RDA%20ECIG%20WEBINAR.pptx?dl=0).

Our speaker Simon Hodson will talk about CODATA and its mission and in particular the preparation for a decadal programme, under the auspices of the International Science Council (ISC), to make data work better for cross-domain global grand challenges. The FAIR principles have enabled us to accelerate progress in improved data stewardship.  It is essential for us to apply further effort to the I and the R of FAIR: interoperability and reusability.  This is particularly striking in those areas of research and policy priority (climate change adaptation, sustainable development, disaster risk reduction, resilient and healthy cities, etc) where progress cannot be made without making data from many different sources work together.

CODATA is the Committee on Data of the International Science Council (ISC). CODATA exists to promote global collaboration to improve the availability and usability of data for all areas of research. CODATA supports the principle that data produced by research and susceptible to be used for research should be as open as possible and as closed as necessary. CODATA works also to advance the interoperability and the usability of such data: research data should be intelligently open or FAIR. By promoting the policy, technological and cultural changes that are essential to make research data more widely available and more usable, CODATA helps advance ISC’s mission of strengthening international science for the benefit of society.

**Short bio**

Simon Hodson has been Executive Director of CODATA since August 2013. Simon is an expert on data policy issues and research data management. He as contributed to influential reports on Current Best Practice for Research Data Management Policies https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.27872 and to the Science International Accord on Open Data in a Big Data World http://www.science-international.org/#accord As part of his CODATA role, Simon leads or participants in numerous projects, Working Groups and Steering Groups. Currently, he is: Project Director, African Open Science Platform Project http://africanopenscience.org.za/?page_id=54 Chair, European Commission’s Expert Group on FAIR Data, which is preparing a report and guidelines on how to make FAIR data a reality https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/pdf/fair_eg.pdf; Co-chair, OECD Global Science Forum Project on Sustainable Business Models for Data Repositories http://www.codata.org/working-groups/oecd-gsf-sustainable-business-models; Co-chair, GEO Data Sharing Working Group, to which CODATA has made a longterm contribution http://www.earthobservations.org/dswg.php; Co-chair, IRIDIUM Research Data Management Glossary Working Group, which is a collaboration between CODATA, CASRAI and Research Data Canada http://www.codata.org/working-groups/standard-glossary-for-research-data-management-iridium Simon is also is a member of the Board of Directors http://datadryad.org/pages/ourTeam of the Dryad Data Repository http://datadryad.org/, a not-for-profit initiative to make the data underlying scientific publications discoverable, freely reusable, and citable; and he sits on the Scientific Advisory Board https://www.cessda.eu/eng/About/Governance of CESSDA ERIC https://www.cessda.eu/, the European data infrastructure for the social sciences. Simon has a strong research background, as well as considerable project and programme management experience: from 2009 to 2013, as Programme Manager, he led two successive phases of Jisc's innovative Managing Research Data programme in the UK.

**Minutes:** 
How CODATA is structured and with what other international organisations interacts with - part of the Interantional Science Council

CODATA has been around since 1996
Initial focus on physics / chemistry
Still making recommendations for standards.
Plank constant is defined by the CODATA Task Force -> as of 16 November 2019, the value of kg is now defined (mathematically) from the Plank value.

4 pillars of activity
1. Data policies
2. Data Science
3. Data Skills
4. Data good practices

-> gathering data from many different sources and collaborating across domains 

3 case studies on Interoperability - metadata and semantics specifications

case study of the IDDO (Oxford Observatory for Infactious Diseases) on the Ebola virus -> aftermath: a lot of NGOs took their data with them -> Pisani et al. 2018: around 65% of datanot available, not shared

issues: sustainability, availability, access

Cross domain approach is necessary to understand the Ebola virus

-> African Open Science Platform - check the vision and strategy document (https://drive.google.com/file/d/11cs1shN9hM2XNbN-yNLwLrsy_7jQ1NAy/view)

-> Humans of data: more into community building

Events that might be of interest: 
- CODATA Conference -> next sesion in P14
- Skills related events -> CODATA-RDA Schools of Research Data Science
Next in Pretoria: dedaline very soon (31 October) - check: http://www.codata.org/news/352/62/Call-for-Applications-The-CODATA-RDA-Research-Data-Science-School-Pretoria-13-24-January-2020-Deadline-15-October-2019

RDA and CODATA - complimentray
RDA provides the forum of WGs and IGs
CODATA has activities that are more strategic





4. **Q&A**
    - RDA-related
    - Professional Development
    - Networking Capacity
    - Other

5. **Closing, plan for next AMA**
    - Every third Wednesday of the month 
        - Next one is [**Wednesday, November 20th**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=RDA+ECEIG+October+AMA&iso=20191120T10&p1=3723&ah=1)



## Q&A

Q: Fotis Psomopoulos: How can ECRs contribute to CODATA?
A: - through the training activities eg COADAT in Beijing or CODATA in RDA
- please feel empowered to contact the co-chairs; CODATA is also going to reach out to RDA WGs that are of relevance to cross domain data
- national committees


Q: Kathryn Reynolds:
Sorry if you have already answered this, I unfortunately missed some of the interoperability section: do you find there are disparate levels of enagagement with FAIR from different domains? If so, are there any that are particularly "good"?
A: Yes, one example is crystallography. Two ways of engaging with domains:
a. engage with international scientific unions - response varies
b. work with those more willing to contribute and collaborate on these aspects

Q: Mohammad Akhlaghi:
What is the position of codata on the software that are necessary to produce/use data?
A: involved in Free and open-source software (FOSS) activities ; 

Q: Deborah Agarwood: Is there a place for qualitative researchers? How are social scientists contributing to CODATA? My perspective comes from background in library & information science, also the humanities.
A: DDI standard for surveys - statictical or qualitative and quantitative surveys etc

Comment by Mohammad Akhlaghi: astronomy also has a long history of sharing data and interoperability. Especially through the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA: ivoa.net).
