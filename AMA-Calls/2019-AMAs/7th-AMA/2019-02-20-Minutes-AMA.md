1. **Welcome**
    - Fotis welcomed everyone and run through the agenda and the topics to be discussed.

    - We will be thanking all of you in an ECEIG tweet after this call. So if you are interested, please add your twitter handles.

2. **Topic of the month**: "_Introduction to Text Mining and its applications_" (by Luca Foppiano)

  [Slides of the talk available here](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02045341)
  
  Luca started to work on the field 4 years ago at the EU Patents office. He has then participated in many projects.
  Types of TDM:
  - Information retrieval
  - Information extraction

  What is TDM?

  Ideal conditions
  - Scalability
  - Repeatability
  - Genericity: same system to be reused by others
  - Automatic: unload from manual work

  Artificial Intellingence
  - started by modeling the human brain - pioneer Alan Turing

  Deep Learning
  - more complecated to apply DP in TDM - because of vectors - 2013 solution: Word 2 Vec

  Search - TDM
  Disambiguations; identify duplicates
  entity matching - recognition of the same entities even when they don't look alike

  INRIA - French Institution of Mathematics
  HAL is an archive for OA data
  idea: INRIA AnHALytics to extract some analytics from the data of the repository

  Demo:

    Intersting part - disambiguation button

## Q&A

Humanities background - into metadata
lots of information - things to absorb
Something that she didn't know - learn more on this matter

Word 2 Vec:
images and video is simple and complex at the same time

distances - associate it with geography

train the model with a lot of data

Knowledge representation and classification?

Word2vec is an evolution of the Bag-of-words approach.

Different cultural approaches Internationally - digging into data challenge  - sharing data over networks 
Industry and Research - more competition in materials ; patents etceg INRIA was more open and close to University
First impression: more realted to teh Institution itself - defend like companies
