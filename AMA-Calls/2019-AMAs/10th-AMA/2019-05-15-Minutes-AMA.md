### Code of Conduct

[RDA Code of Coduct](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/rda-council-private/outcomes/draft-comment-rda-code-conduct)
- Respect others and their contributions
- Don’t make people feel uncomfortable
- No means no

### Structure of the call

1. **Welcome**
    - Elli welcomed everyone, introduced the speaker and informed about the structure of this call.
    - Reminded that the AMA calls are monthly, on the third Wednesday of each month. This means that our next AMA call will be [**Wednesday, June 19th**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=RDA+ECEIG+9th+AMA&iso=20190619T10&p1=3723&ah=1). Probably the **last** one before the Summer break.
    - At the end of the document, we have an _"I can offer... / I need help in..."_ Section. Feel free to add anything there.
    - We will be thanking all of you in an ECEIG tweet after this call. So if you are interested, please add your twitter handles.

2. **Topic of the month**: "_Simple rules to create robust ML models_" (by [Kyriakos Chatzidimitriou](http://kyrcha.info/))


    **Material**

    Slides of the talk are available [on SpeakerDeck here](https://speakerdeck.com/kyrcha/simple-rules-for-building-robust-machine-learning-models).


    **Presentation**
    
- Kyriakos bio and tip for early career researchers -> be happy! choose to solve problems you like
- what is supervised ML
- what he is working on:
    - deep website aesthetics
    - continous implicit authe
    - automl
    - machine learning on source code
- Tips: 
1.  The 3 sets
    - training
    - validation
    - test
2. Validation and test sets should reflect the data you expect to see in the future
3. There are dataset size heuristics
4. Choose one metric
5. Always do your exploratory analysis data 
    - density plots
    - correlation plots
    - box plots
6. When preprocessing use statistics based only on the training set
7. Increase the number you do 10-fold CV to get even more accurate estimates of performance
8. Use Wilcoxon statistical test to choose between two models
9. Time is money (PM and Cloud Computing), start with a small dataset, debug and then increase the size
10. If you don't have enough data, find or create more data
11. Decide if you strive for performance or interpretability
12. Learn the strong points of each model
13. Become a knowledgeable trader of bias-variance
14. Finish of with an ensemble
15. Tune hyperparameters ... but up to a point
16. Start with a simple waterfall like process:
    - Study the problem
    - EDA
    - Define optimization strategy
    - Do feature engineering
    - Modelling
    - Ensembling



## Q&A
Q1: Data heterogeinity - which are the rules to apply
- data wrangling, export, annnotation etc to fit in the model

Q2: Do you work with open access data generated by academic research?
- mainly software engineering
- data is uploaded in Zenodo and licensed

### RDA Related



### Professional Development


### Networking Capacity



### Other



### I can offer... / I need help in...


3. **Three (plus one) Sections of Q&A**
    - RDA-related
    - Professional Development
    - Networking Capacity
    - Other

4. **Closing, plan for next AMA**
    - Every third Wednesday of the month 
        - Next one is [**Wednesday, June 19th**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=RDA+ECEIG+9th+AMA&iso=20190619T10&p1=3723&ah=1)
