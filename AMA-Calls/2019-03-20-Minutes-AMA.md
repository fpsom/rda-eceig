### Structure of the call

1. **Welcome**
    - Fotis welcomed everyone and run through the agenda and the topics to be discussed.
    - Reminded that the AMA calls are monthly, on the third Wednesday of each month. This means that our next AMA call will be [**Wednesday, April 17th**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=RDA+ECEIG+9th+AMA&iso=20190417T10&p1=3723&ah=1)

    - We will be thanking all of you in an ECEIG tweet after this call. So if you are interested, please add your twitter handles.

2. **Topic of the month**: "_Four simple recommendations for research software development_" (by [Fotis E. Psomopoulos](https://fpsom.github.io/))

Fotis Bio; deputy coordinator of the training platform in Greece and co-lead of the Best Practises for Research Software WG.
- ELIXIR is a paneuropean infra project on life scineces focused in bioibformatics (5years now); tools that can facilitate research lifecycle and training to the services and topics life computing related
- They have nodes, coordinated by a hub

- Why do we need best practices? more than 90% of scientists are self-taught; low quality of software and sustainability
- Goal: sustainability of software development
- Principles and best practises - metrics
- 10 metrics
- 4 recommendations:
- 1. accesibility - suse a vesrion control repo ; push back to that - not ready software or cultural issues
- 2. discoverability - open doesn't mean that it is findable; metadata ; visibility
- 3. re-usability - what is the license and how to use the content
- 4. Governace - how the others will build upon your work

Training to nurture best practices:
- Carpentries ; Lessons: 1st - DOIs and encourage to create a repo and use GitHub; 2nd - what license to use and how to add this information in the repo ; 3rd - rules for how to contribute; 4th - metadata and how they are associated - 2 exercises: what ontologies and metadata schemas are and how to add the repo in the registy (BioTools)
- Goal: cultural change - prososal: create software management plan ; at the moment: by ELIXIR; also for this development they are in contact with others like publishers (e.g. Springer) -> there will be FAIR Guidelines
- What is missing: the adoption from the community

Raman: from the perspective of humanities they are facing the same issues; in the end you ahve an application but what happens after the project ends?
good idea: metadata for software and software management plans
