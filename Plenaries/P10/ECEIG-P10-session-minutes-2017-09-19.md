## Agenda

- _14:00 - 14:30_: Welcome, brief introduction (Inna), overall purpose
  - What kinds of programs can be supported?
  - What does it mean to have a program that encourages early career researchers to be engaged in RDA?
- _14:30 - 14:50_: Group Discussion and break-out groups on topics below
- _14:50 - 15:10_: Quick report back, a question per group (others add key points)
- _15:10 - 15:30_: Early Career and Engagement Interest Group: An Overview


## Discussion during breakouts:


### 1. How can RDA better help early career professionals and researchers? Please provide specific examples.

#### Full Group
1. Job fair aspect: Connect industry with academia, post available industry positions through RDA or let RDA members post jobs somewhere on the website, such as an online job forum. Ability to post resumes so that employers shop for fellows. Also, networking for jobs? Referrals from RDA for fellows?
2. Help improve training in data management/data science. Workshop opportunities? How about software / data carpentry within RDA?
3. E-learning platform for getting to know the organization, fundamentals of RDA

#### Group A (incl. Inna, Devan, Tobias, etc.)
4. Interaction between IG and WG has been very spotty with RDA fellows -- more formalized mentorship. Help new people to find where they can best fit in.
5. Multiple disciplines / domains in RDA, so maybe cross-domain talking?
6. Mentoring is a recurring theme in RDA. Possible way for it to work - lightweight mentorship:  informal meeting before the plenary starts and commitment to introduce to other people, plus a meeting at the end.
7. Possibility of people signing up to be mentors/mentees from each working group or interest group.

#### Group B (incl. Jane, Sarah, etc.)
8. Better connection between fellows and the ‘job market’.
9. Better outreach to the younger/upcoming generation to have more robust data management skills.
10. Current benefit: connecting data share fellows with people outside their field.
11. Future suggestion to add to fellowship: year-long individual project, but also a 6 month collaborative project.
12. Past downside: RG/IG’s identified need and asked fellows to fill that role, but there was lack of commitment from mentors so it was not successful.
13. Future suggestion: To have more added value for early-career professionals (such as librarians), not just students.
14. More opportunities to represent an organization/institute(?) as an early-career rep.
15. Provide different levels of engagement: i.e, to bring to graduate students, or to funding agencies, or to an institution in order to solve real problems for people.  Such as LIDS (library information for data science) bootcamp.
16. Skill building boot camps, coding, data management, etc.
17. Training camps to implement skills and outcomes of RDA WG’s and IG’s. To further deepen collaborations across WG’s and IG’s.

### 2. How can fellows have a positive impact on RDA?  How can they better contribute? Please provide specific examples if you can?

#### Group A (incl. Inna, Devan, Tobias, etc.)
1. Better fit between fellow projects and IG/WG. E.g., let groups give fellow tasks that are related to the group. IG or WG identifies the need, fellow works, having guidance on original direction.
2. Continuous follow-up with fellows or own space to contribute ideas can help with being pro-active.
3. Doing smth together is an important part. Possibility of early career fellows coming together to work on a project, and having space/time at plenary to work on it.
4. Project half a year in scope so that before 1st plenary there is some result, then discuss as a group and produce a collective product. Are 2 projects realistic within a fellowship?
5. European perspective - need something lightweight for collaborative part.
6. List of research ideas on the plenary website - and let fellows pick and propose solutions.

#### Group B (incl. Jane, Sarah, etc.)
7. More focus for RDA Data Share Fellows
8. Get the fellows involved with the Knowledge Atlas (6 keywords on each IG/WG’s)
9. A more direct conduit for early career RDA folks to connect to the RDA leadership and decision-making.


### 3. Assuming different regions have different models of funding and early career engagement, how can we make it work for RDA global? What are the options for cross-regional collaboration, interaction, and engagement

#### Group A (incl. Inna, Devan, Tobias, etc.)
1. Why are the models of early career engagement different across regions?

#### Group B (incl. Jane, Sarah, etc.)
2. A virtual component to connect RDA-USA fellows to RDA-EU fellows.
3. Lunch may not be the best venue to facilitate USA-EU interaction.
4. RDA Fellows - Happy Hour or Brunch, Coffee, etc?  Something on a smaller (and quieter than lunch) scale.
5. Sustained connection with other fellows, ‘Fellow Network’ or listerve to connect, as well as post jobs.  Social networking site?  RDA-EU fellows are required to write a blog-post.
6. Career-tracking of previous fellows, made available to current fellows.  In order to see what the career path of a data scientist looks like.
7. Make the RDA website more accessible to the RDA community.
