- Strategies to keep fellows together during plenaries
- Previous fellows experiences
- Discussion on next steps and strategies


## Discussion points:

- Focus on early career researchers and professionals because the need the most support
- _Help them navigate RDA (do not put this, resonates more for newcomers - out of focus)_
- Establish a mentoring progamme
- To network across domains and with any charter (essentially a **network of peers**)
- A means for people who were newcomers (mentors now) to pass on knowledge about lessons learned to newcomers (-> implemented as a **live document that captures lessons learned, tips accumulation of experience**, also as mentors)
- Communication of resources and funding opportunities / support
- (_mechanisms_) Formalize lunches / meeting space, time / social events @ plenaries for Fellows
- (_mechanisms_) Automatically add communication details of new Fellows (EU/US) in the Group page

### Elevated pitch
- Build peers network
- Live document of advice
- Mentoring

### Additional session notes:

- Take a look at [polar early career scientists](http://www.apecs.is/) - useful model
- Think less about representing domains and doing outreach and focus on anchoring early career researchers, giving them visibility, pointing them to what is relevant within RDA, and sharing experiences
- It's useful to have a social dimension (e.g., organize a lunch or drinks)
- **Early career are different from newcomers**, needs are different. Focus on early career and their needs: how to get the most out of your RDA experience, how to speak at a session, networking with different people in a friendly environment, mutual support.
- Having mentors is useful, recruiting can be part of this IG (both disciplinary and cross-disciplinary).
Look into creating a page and a mailing list for the group now.

## Follow-up actions

1. Update the draft Charter with the comments
2. Associating names for each task (if no-one is available, maybe rethink the task?) - MVP
3. Look for a senior RDA member to join as the “start” of the mentoring programme (Lynn Yarmey?)
4. Create the IG Group
5. Announce the Group and Charter document - tweet, email (early career networking group?)
6. Apply for review/approval
7. Send the (final?) Charter for all (announce)
