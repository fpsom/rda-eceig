## Minutes

Introduction and brief overview of the agenda given by Devan and Fotis

*Scope of the session:* spread awareness for the group’s goals and get feedback 

*Scope of the IG:* provide a space for early careers and newcomers and produce recommendations documents for diverse research communities, supporting diversity and interdisciplinarity in collaborations

*Objectives:*
1. The ECEIG is not only for RDA newcomers or early career scientists -> ECEIG community welcomes also researchers and individuals that have changed career path(s)
2. Launch and strengthen the “Mentoring Programme”
3. Exchange ideas and establish collaborations, encouraging interdisciplinarity
4. Create a social network for early career researchers and professionals

Tools to bridge the gap between mentors and mentees, initiate discussions and provide information/updates:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/fpsom/rda-eceig): maintains information and outputs of the ECEIG

- [Slack channel](https://rda-eceig.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages): the space to ask and answer questions!
Use Slack to develop threads derived by topics identified in questions posed by mentees.

*Future thoughts:* Youtube channel to facilitate discussions and activities, such as webinars, etc.


## Lightning Talks

[Sarah Ramdeen](https://rd-alliance.org/users/ramdeen) </br>
University of Alabama </br>
Librarian; recently defended dissertation :)

*Topics:* inconsistent metadata, difficult access points to physical samples, eg rock samples </br>
Interested to see outcomes and products that might be used by others</br>
Part of IGs and WGs for physical samples; Co-Chair of Archives and Records Professionals for Research Data IG; Member of RDA TAB Liaisons

*Expectations from the ECEIG:*
A space for mentorship in navigating international collaborations and research opportunities that develop out of RDA. </br>
A venue to create opportunities and provide support for early career members. </br>
A place to find peers who understand the challenges faced when early in one's career </br>
A conduit for sharing experiences and challenges faced by EC folks back up the chain to RDA leadership. </br>
Also, how to facilitate new WG/IG ideas from early-career folks.


[John Borghi](https://rd-alliance.org/users/john-borghi) </br>

Before: neuroscientist

*Recent achievement:* Survey on Data Management practices in neuroimaging </br>
Questions asked to scientists: where they published and how they managed data, etc. </br>
Results: Emerging Practices - pre-print </br>
Interesting fact of the survey: discussions with psychologists 

*Expectations from the ECEIG:* Community; although not newcomer, RDA still does not feel as open of a community.


Anne Thiessen </br>
Data Ambassador

Funding for US has ended
 
*Expectations from the ECEIG:* to become the tool that helps communicating success stories and convinces funders to allocate resources

*Direct and measurable impact:* A lot of the previous RDA-US Fellows became later IG/WG chairs, so it definitely has a 

Question posed by Anne: How would relevant suggestions to funders look like?

Elli gave apologies on behalf of Peter McQuilton from the University of Oxford, who expressed his interest in being a mentor though he couldn’t make it to the RDA Plenary. Peter is closely associated to FAIRsharing, an interlinked platform that contains registries of standards, databases and data policies.


## Suggestions/ Feedback:

1. Having mentors posting travel schedules to Conferences as an opportunity to meet in person

2. Add in guidelines for mentees: “Attend where possible”

3. Reach out to other RDA communities like RDA national nodes and beyond, more internationally; General observation: more difficult to find mentees

4. Create templates for the posters to be utilised for harmonised mentees presentations

5. Where to look for support: 
*   [FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/) for training
*   [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/) for national support
