## Minutes

Introduction and brief overview of the agenda given by Devan and Fotis

*Scope of the session:* spread awareness for the group’s goals and get feedback 

*Scope of the IG:* provide a space for early careers and newcomers and produce recommendations documents for diverse research communities, supporting diversity and interdisciplinarity in collaborations

*Objectives:*
1. The ECEIG is not only for RDA newcomers or early career scientists -> ECEIG community welcomes also researchers and individuals that have changed career path(s)
2. Launch and strengthen the “Mentoring Programme”
3. Exchange ideas and establish collaborations, encouraging interdisciplinarity
4. Create a social network for early career researchers and professionals

Tools to bridge the gap between mentors and mentees, initiate discussions and provide information/updates:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/fpsom/rda-eceig): maintains information and outputs of the ECEIG

- [Slack channel](https://rda-eceig.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages): the space to ask and answer questions!
Use Slack to develop threads derived by topics identified in questions posed by mentees.

*Future thoughts:* Youtube channel to facilitate discussions and activities, such as webinars, etc.


## Lightning Talks

[Sarah Ramdeen](https://rd-alliance.org/users/ramdeen)
University of Alabama
Librarian; recently defended dissertation :)

*Topics:* inconsistent metadata, difficult access points to physical samples, eg rock samples 
Interested to see outcomes and products that might be used by others
Part of IGs and WGs for physical samples; Co-Chair of Archives and Records Professionals for Research Data IG; Member of RDA TAB Liaisons

*Expectations from the ECEIG:*
A space for mentorship in navigating international collaborations and research opportunities that develop out of RDA.
A venue to create opportunities and provide support for early career members. 
A place to find peers who understand the challenges faced when early in one's career
A conduit for sharing experiences and challenges faced by EC folks back up the chain to RDA leadership.
Also, how to facilitate new WG/IG ideas from early-career folks.


[John Borghi](https://rd-alliance.org/users/john-borghi)
Digital Libraries California
Before: neuroscientist

*Recent achievement:* Survey on Data Management practices in neuroimaging
Questions asked to scientists: where they published and how they managed data, etc.
Results: Emerging Practices - pre-print 
Interesting fact of the survey: discussions with psychologists 

*Expectations from the ECEIG:* Community; although not newcomer, RDA still does not feel as open of a community.


Anne Thiessen
Data Ambassador

Funding for US has ended
 
*Expectations from the ECEIG:* to become the tool that helps communicating success stories and convinces funders to allocate resources

*Direct and measurable impact:* A lot of the previous RDA-US Fellows became later IG/WG chairs, so it definitely has a 

Question posed by Anne: How would relevant suggestions to funders look like?

*Recent research:* Collaboration and communication of science mainly at the end of the project in environmental sciences and SSH 
*Everyday job relates to:* metadata and data analysis and primary data 
Platform for ethnography - experimental
Co-chair of Imperi metadata group

*Expectations from the ECEIG:*
- How Data Share is related to professional recognition/reward
- Networking and meeting people!


[Asahiko Matsuda](https://www.rd-alliance.org/users/asahiko-matsuda)

*Expectations from the ECEIG:* Communication and research interests exchange


[Vivian Wong](https://www.rd-alliance.org/users/vivian-wong)

*Topics:* Archival research and ethnographic data

*Current research interest:* How to make oral history data searchable; challenges in creating such data: eg media software familiarity and preservation

*Expectations from the ECEIG:* Friendly environment; space that provides support


[Lorinette S. Wirth](https://www.rd-alliance.org/users/lorinette-wirth)

Elli gave apologies on behalf of Peter McQuilton from the University of Oxford, who expressed his interest in being a mentor though he couldn’t make it to the RDA Plenary. Peter is closely associated to FAIRsharing, an interlinked platform that contains registries of standards, databases and data policies.


## Suggestions/ Feedback:

1. Having mentors posting travel schedules to Conferences as an opportunity to meet in person

2. Add in guidelines for mentees: “Attend where possible”

3. Reach out to other RDA communities like RDA national nodes and beyond, more internationally; General observation: more difficult to find mentees

4. Create templates for the posters to be utilised for harmonised mentees presentations

5. Where to look for support: 
*   [FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/) for training
*   [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/) for national support
