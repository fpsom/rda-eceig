# RDA Early Career and Engagement IG

**Status**: Recognised & Endorsed
**Chairs**: Devan Ray Donaldson; Fotis Psomopoulos; Elli Papadopoulou

The purpose of the [RDA Early Career and Engagement IG (ECEIG)](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/early-career-and-engagement-ig)  is to provide a focal point for Early and Mid-Career Researchers and Professionals, including those involved in various RDA-related fellowships and Early Career programs.

RDA members recognize that there is a need to create a space in RDA for those who are at the beginning stages of their careers. Specifically, RDA members recognized that Early Career Researchers and Professionals usually need additional support for:
- networking amongst themselves to learn about other Early Career scientists and their research, i.e., establishing a “network of peers”, and
- mentoring from senior RDA members who are interested in mentoring Early Career Researchers and Professionals.

Designating time on each RDA plenary schedule for this IG is important because those who are in the beginning stages of their careers have their own unique talents and strengths and they represent the next generation of RDA; they are critical to the future of RDA. At a BoF conducted during RDA P8 in Denver, CO a group of Early Career fellows agreed to explore the idea of creating an IG centering on those who are in the early stages of their careers and helping them effectively engage with RDA.  This effort was continued and crystallized at a dedicated networking session during RDA P9 in Barcelona, Spain.

## ECEIG Objectives
While other efforts exist in RDA to support Early Career Researchers and Professionals, such as the RDA-US and RDA-EU fellowship programs, the RDA ECEIG seeks to complement existing efforts by: (i) building a peers network, (ii) maintaining a “live” document of advice for Early Career Researchers and Professionals, and (iii) creating opportunities for formal and informal mentoring within RDA. Specifically, objectives of this IG are to:
- Focus on Early Career Researchers and Professionals because they need the most support
- Establish a volunteer-based mentoring progamme
- Network across domains to establish an interdisciplinary network of peers
- Provide a space for people who have more experience with RDA to pass on knowledge and lessons learned to Early Career Researchers and Professionals
- Create a social outlet specifically for Early Career Researchers and Professionals

The ECEIG is open to all RDA members to participate, and is of particular interest to Researchers and Professionals in the Early and Mid-Career stages. This IG is also of interest to more experienced RDA members who desire to mentor and support Early and Mid-Career Researchers and Professionals.

## Goals of this Repository
This is a dedicated repository for maintaining documents with advice/lessons/guidelines as well as receiving continuous feedback and edits in the form of issues.
